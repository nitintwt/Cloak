# Kiitian - Web App for Anonymous Discussion
Kiitian is a web app designed for anonymous discussions within a college community. It was created specifically for my college batch mates. In this web app, users can log in using their college provided student email ID, ensuring that only authorized individuals from the college community can participate. The identity of the logged in person remains anonymous, allowing them to share posts on various topics such as college , life, academics, or anything else. Each post includes a comment section for further engagement.
